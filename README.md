Predictive Analysis of Vehicle Pricing Using Machine Learning: An Application of Extremely Randomized Trees Regressor on Adapted Car Advertisement Data (Specific Citroen and Fiat Models)
The automotive market is driven by several factors that come together to determine the price of vehicles. In an age where data-driven insights are crucial, leveraging machine learning has become a key approach to unraveling these complex dynamics. This study utilizes the Extremely Randomized Trees Regressor, a powerful algorithm known for its effectiveness in handling complex datasets, to predict vehicle prices by analyzing attributes such as model, color, and fuel type. The data, originally collected by Huang et al. (2021), was meticulously adapted and transformed to zero in on specific factors that play a significant role in price determination. 

# Introduction 
This paper aims to explore the key factors influencing the advertised prices of specific vehicle models using a detailed dataset. The analysis focuses on understanding which vehicle attributes most significantly impact the price, utilizing a combination of data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning techniques. The study begins by filtering a dataset to include only specific vehicle models, followed by a series of data processing steps to prepare the data for analysis. Ultimately, machine learning models are employed to identify the most influential features on vehicle pricing.
The primary objective of this research is to determine the most influential attributes that affect the advertised prices of vehicles. By analyzing specific vehicle models such as the Citroen C3, DS3, Fiat Grande Punto, and Fiat Panda, the study seeks to provide insights into how factors like fuel type, vehicle color, mileage, and other features correlate with price. The goal is to use this analysis to assist in pricing strategies and market understanding within the automotive industry.
The sample for this research consists of vehicle advertisements sourced from a dataset that includes detailed information about various car models. The dataset is filtered to focus on four specific models’ other key variables such as body type, vehicle color, price, mileage and the number of seats. This sample represents a targeted subset of the broader automotive market, focusing on popular hatchback models and their pricing dynamics.

# Methodology and Data Processing
In this research, we were able to utilize the Extremely Randomized Trees regression model to analyze factors influencing vehicle prices. This model is well-suited to the objective as it allows a robust ensemble learning method known for handling complex datasets effectively (Geurts et al., 2006).  Data Preparation began with filtering the dataset to focus on specific vehicle models Citroen C3, DS3, Fiat Grande Punto, and Fiat Panda. The dataset was further refined by selecting hatchback vehicles with top five most frequently advertised colors, manual transmission and either petrol or diesel as the fuel type. The decision to select only the manual transmission was based on the need to avoid skewness and to ensure balance. The missing values in some of the columns were addressed by filling them with the mode ensuring data consistency. We used other visualizations, including pair plots, histogram, box plots, and scatter plots, to explore relationships between vehicle features and prices, offering a deeper understanding of the data before proceeding with the next steps.
The data was then split into training and testing sets, with 30% of the data reserved for testing, and stratification by the maker type ensured the distribution of vehicle models in both training and test set. Model Training involved using the Extra Trees regression model on the prepared dataset. Performance was evaluated using the R² score, which measures the proportion of variance in vehicle prices explained by the model, and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which quantifies the average magnitude of errors between predicted and actual prices. Visualization and Feature Importance analyses were conducted post-training to extract and examine the importance of various vehicle attributes, this helped provide insights into which of the vehicle characters significantly influenced vehicle prices. With all the steps utilized, it was important to keep in mind certain limitations, such as the potential for overfitting and the impact of data quality on model accuracy and validity (Geurts et al., 2006; Breiman, 2001)
# Results and Discussion
The analysis utilized the Extremely Randomized Trees Regressor to predict vehicle prices based on attributes such as model, color, fuel type by evaluating the created model performance using R² and RMSE metrics. The results indicated a strong performance with the training set achieving an R² of 0.99 indicating a very high level of fit and an RMSE of 186.19, while the results indicated a strong performance with the test set achieving an R² of 0.99 indicating a very high level of fit and an RMSE of 1318.81. The model's performance on the testing set also demonstrated reliability for providing accurate predictions.
Feature importance was assessed using permutation-based methods to understand the influence of each attribute on the price predictions. The most significant predictor was petrol as a fuel type suggesting that whether a vehicle uses petrol significantly impacts its price, potentially due to market preferences or fuel economy perceptions. Other significant impacts on price were Vehicle Models, Grande Punto and Panda. Since we considered six variables, the model of the vehicle, number of seats and the mileage have lower but noticeable importance for price prediction, compared to fuel type and the car models highlighted above.
Given that color does have an impact on vehicle pricing, its influence is relatively minor when compared to more significant factors like fuel type and model. This finding reflects common consumer behavior, where practical features and brand/model preference tend to carry more weight than aesthetic choices like color. Lastly, while the number of seats might be important to certain buyers, it doesn’t significantly drive vehicle prices across the board. These insights suggest that when setting prices or developing pricing models, it may be more effective to focus on key attributes like fuel type and vehicle model, rather than on secondary factors like color or seating capacity.
# Conclusion
The analysis showed that predicting vehicle prices with the Extremely Randomized Trees Regressor is both effective and reliable. The most influential factors are vehicle models and fuel types that agree with industry standards. For instance, a study on used car price prediction emphasized that the type of fuel a vehicle uses, and its model are key determinants of its resale value (Bukvić et.al 2022, Das Adhhikary et al 2022). Reflecting consumer preferences and market demand like color and the number of seats do have some impact, they are much less important in comparison. In conclusion, it would be wise for car manufacturers and dealerships to focus on these core attributes when setting prices. Given this consistency with broader industry observations, the insights and model are very applicable in the real world moving forward. Additionally, as the market evolves with electric vehicles our model can evolve further into considering comparisons between price influence on this other category of vehicles.
